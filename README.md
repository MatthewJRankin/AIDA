Air Infiltration Development Algorithm:

This is a translation of the algorithm found in "A Guide to Energy Efficient Ventilation" (Martin W. Liddament, 1996). The program was originally written in BASIC, however, for ease of application, the decision was made to convert the code into Python.

The algorithm provides a good approximation of infiltration rates and air change rates for a given set of data entered by the user. User-entered quantities include building volume, number of flow paths, height, flow coefficient, flow exponent and wind pressure coefficient for each path, as well as climatic conditions: external and internal temperatures, and wind speed.
